# Best Practices

This section provides guidance on when and when not to use the Multidimensional GeoTIFF and Temporal GeoTIFF formats.

## When to use it?

### Multidimensional or Temporal GeoTIFF

Ideal for machine learning [mini-cubes](https://doi.org/10.1017/eds.2024.22) workflows, especially when each sample should be retrieved in a single operation. It also excels at sharing data with non-specialized users, offering seamless access and compatibility with commonly used geospatial tools.

### NetCDF, HDF5, or Zarr

Ideal for complex data analysis workflows, these formats provide superior flexibility, supporting nested groups and advanced chunking strategies. They are ideal for storing large datacubes with detailed metadata.


## Analysing Performance on Local Disk

We evaluate the **READ** performance of the Multidimensional GeoTIFF format by comparing it to NetCDF, HDF5, Zarr and Zipped Zarr. We define two possible scenarios: a **spatial chunking strategy** and an **spatial-temporal chunking strategy**. We consider a 5D datacube with the following dimensions: `simulation`, `time`, `band`, `x`, and `y`. 

The datacube has the following shape: 
    - small (10Mb): 3 x 5 x 8 x 512 x 512
    - medium (100Mb): 3 x 200 x 8 x 512 x 512
    - large (1Gb): 3 x 200 x 8 x 2048 x 2048
